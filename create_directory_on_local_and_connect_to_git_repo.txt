🔹 How to Push Local Folder to GitHub 🔹

1️⃣ Open Your Project in VS Code
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Open your project folder.

2️⃣ Initialize Git Repository (If Not Already Done)
   Open VS Code’s terminal (press Ctrl + `) and run:

   git init
   ✅ This converts your folder into a Git repository.

3️⃣ Add All files to Staging

   git add .
   ✅ All files are now staged for commit.

4️⃣ Commit Your Changes

   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ✅ This saves your files in your local repository.

5️⃣ Create a Repository on GitHub
   - Go to https://github.com.
   - Click + in the top-right corner.
   - Select “New repository”.
   - Name your repository.
   - Choose visibility (Public or Private).
   - Do not check “Add a README”.
   - Click “Create repository”.

6️⃣ Connect Local Repo to GitHub Repo

   After creating your repository, you will see instructions to connect:

   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

   ✅ This adds a remote origin, sets main, and pushes your code.

7️⃣ Confirm Push

   ✅ Reload your GitHub repository’s page.
   Your files should be there.
